<p>Welcome to the <strong>First Edition</strong> (Cohort <strong>C1</strong>) of ML-1</p>
<p>The objective of this module is to provide a fundamental understanding of data analysis. The course proceeds in 3 parts, following the Data Science Process:</p>
<p><strong>Obtain and clean the data</strong>: we will teach you how to obtain, clean, and process data from different sources such as scraped web pages, spreadsheets, APIs, and documents.</p>
<p><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis</strong>: we develop your skills in pre-modeling and post-modeling exploratory data analysis and visualization. This part is all about understanding your data.</p>
<p><strong>Modeling</strong>: We choose some very specific models to cover, from the perspective of teaching techniques which are generalizable to any models. Thus we will cover classification and recommendation engines. We’ll also cover similarity and PCA, as a way of understanding structure in your data and the models you ran on them.</p>
<p><img src="/ml1-c1/index.assets/coursetopics.png" /></p>
<p>After you finish this module, you will be ready to run the entire data science process, all on your own, from fetching (from the internet or databases) and cleaning the data, setting up pipelines, to exploratory data analysis, visualization, and modeling.</p>
<p>This page introduces you to the team, the basic instructions, the schedule, and various elements of our class.</p>

<h2 id="the-coursework">The Coursework</h2>
<p>We have very carefully designed the coursework to give you, the student, a wholesome learning experience. Each week shall include:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 Sessions</li>
<li>1 Lab</li>
<li>Office hours</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="session-what-to-expect">Session: What to expect</h3>
<p><img src="/ml1-c1/index.assets/session.png" /></p>
<p>Before the session begins, students are expected to complete a pre-class reading assignment and attempt a quiz based on the same.</p>
<p>A session will have the following pedagogy layout which will be repeated a few times:</p>
<ul>
<li>Approx. 10-15 minutes of live online instruction followed by a quiz</li>
<li>Some sessions will have hands-on coding exercises or group activities</li>
<li>Sessions will help students develop the intuition for the core concepts, provide the necessary mathematical background, and provide guidance on technical details.</li>
<li>Sessions will be accompanied by relevant examples to clarify key concepts and techniques.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the session, students are expected to complete a short post-class quiz based on the principal concepts covered in class and optional post-class reading will be provided.</p>
<h3 id="lab-what-to-expect">Lab: What to expect</h3>
<p><img src="/ml1-c1/index.assets/lab.png" /></p>
<p>A lab is a TA driven 1.5 hour session that is divided into 3 major parts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each lab begins by solving parts of a complete problem. This problem is designed to help you with your homework and further elucidate concepts you learned in lecture.</li>
<li>After discussing exercises, we will have a semi-formal Q/A session. The first part of this session is limited to homework questions, but the second part is more free-for-all, where you can ask any doubts that lingered over from lecture.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-class">The Class</h2>
<p><strong>Welcome Session</strong> - Preparing for this class</p>
<p>There will be a Welcome Session scheduled on 25 January 2021 at 7:00 PM IST for all registered students. Please check your mail for more information.</p>
<p><img src="/ml1-c1/index.assets/schedule.png" /></p>
<p>NOTE: Below timings are in IST</p>
