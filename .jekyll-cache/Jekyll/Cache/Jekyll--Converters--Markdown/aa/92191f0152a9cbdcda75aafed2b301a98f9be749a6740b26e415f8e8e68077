<h2 id="why-use-chat">Why use chat</h2>
<p>The forums at <a href="https://discourse.univ.ai">discourse.univ.ai</a> are the right places to have extended and interesting discussions about various topics.</p>
<p>However matters of logistics and co-ordination often require immediate action. You might want to</p>
<ul>
<li>set up a meeting with some of your friends</li>
<li>just get to know everyone</li>
<li>do a quick video chat with another person or with members of your group (<code>/jitsi</code> on any channel is the ticket)</li>
<li>collect questions while lecture is on to ask the professor</li>
<li>do polls<img src="/ml2-c1/slack.assets/Screenshot%202020-07-01%2002.39.34.png" /></li>
<li>point people to questions answered or discussions had on discourse. Type <code>/discourse help</code> for details. You can even archive some parts of conversations to discourse.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have multiple chat channels, and you can create your own for ad-hoc sub groups.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>#watercooler</code> for just chatting. All suitable-for-work subjects acceptable here</li>
<li><code>#homework</code> for homework conversation</li>
<li><code>#project</code> for project conversation</li>
<li><code>#officehours</code> for office hour co-ordination and questions</li>
<li><code>#lecture</code> for within lecture logistics and question collection</li>
</ul>
<p>Below you can see a Jitsi videoconference being set up in the <code>#watercooler</code> channelâ€¦</p>
