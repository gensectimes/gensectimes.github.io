<h2 id="the-lecture-join-a-class-meeting">The lecture: Join a class meeting</h2>
<p>Lectures happen in the main class zoom meeting. This is how you join it.</p>
<p>First, join the class a bit early to familiarize yourself with things and get comfortable.</p>
<p>You will need the class <strong>meeting Id number</strong>. The meeting Id number will be, or have been sent to you via email, so as to assure its privacy.</p>

<p>Proper zoom etiquette is to <strong>mute yourself</strong> when the class begins. Whenever you need to speak in class, un-mute yourself and speak, and then re-mute yourself after speaking. This ensures no echoing and disruption in the class.</p>
<h2 id="labs-breakout-rooms">Labs: Breakout Rooms</h2>
<p>Once or twice in the lecture, you will adjourn with a Teaching Assistant (TA) to a breakout room to work on some coding, which will help build your understanding.</p>
<p>In the zoom application, Breakout rooms are sessions that are split off from the main Zoom meeting. They allow the participants to meet in smaller groups.</p>
<p>You will be pre-assigned to breakout rooms during your session. Your TA will invite you to join the breakout room.</p>
