<p>Welcome to the <strong>First Edition</strong> of PyDS . The objective of this module is to provide fundamental understanding of the python programming language needed to follow an introductory course in Data Science.</p>
<p>You will start with the basics of python, statistics, linear algebra and calculus.</p>
<p>Finally, the course will provide a basic introduction to linear regression from scratch.</p>
<p>At the end of this module, you will have the tools and know the concepts needed to successfully undertake a rigorous course in machine learning.</p>
<p>This page introduces you to the team, the basic instructions, the schedule and various elements of our class.</p>

<h2 id="the-coursework">The Coursework</h2>
<p>We have very carefully designed the coursework to give you, the student, a wholesome learning experience.</p>
<p>We will hold two 90 minute weekend sessions per week for a total of five weeks.</p>
<h3 id="session---what-to-expect">Session - What to expect</h3>
<p><img src="/index.assets/session.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Before the session begins, students are expected to complete a pre-class reading assignment and and attempt a quiz based on the same.</p>
<p>A session will have the following pedagogy layout which will be repeated three times:</p>
<ul>
<li>Approx. 15 minutes of live online instruction followed by approx 15 minutes of Q/A + Quiz + Exercises.</li>
<li>Sessions will help students develop the intuition for the core concepts, provide the necessary mathematical background, and provide guidance on technical details.</li>
<li>Sessions will be accompanied by relevant examples to clarify key concepts and techniques.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the session, students are expected to complete a short post-class quiz based on the principal concepts covered in class.</p>

<h2 id="diversity-inclusion">Diversity &amp; Inclusion</h2>
<p>We actively seek and welcome people of diverse identities, from across the spectrum of disciplines and methods since Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly mediates our social, cultural, economic, and political interactions [1].</p>
<p>We believe in creating and maintaining an inclusive learning environment where all members feel safe, respected, and capable of producing their best work.</p>
<p>We commit to an experience for all participants that is free from – Harassment, bullying, and discrimination which includes but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offensive comments related to age, race, religion, creed, color, gender (including transgender/gender identity/gender expression), sexual orientation, medical condition, physical or intellectual disability, pregnancy, or medical conditions, national origin or ancestry.</li>
<li>Intimidation, personal attacks, harassment, unnecessary disruption of talks during any of the learning activities.</li>
</ul>
