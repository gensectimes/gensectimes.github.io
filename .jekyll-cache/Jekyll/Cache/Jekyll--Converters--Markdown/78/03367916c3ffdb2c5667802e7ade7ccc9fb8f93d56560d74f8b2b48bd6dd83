<h2 id="capabilities">Capabilities</h2>
<p>Its a fairly new system, but allows us to provide you with Multiple Choice Questions, and the ability to run code on a cloud backend. Currently we use the Open Source <a href="https://us.mybinder.org">MyBinder</a> service, but are implementing our own cloud (which <a href="/ml2-c1/nbpad.html">NBPad</a> will use as well).</p>

<p>In the future, we will be implementing Anki Decks on this platform as well. We also use <a href="https://us.edstem.org">EdStem</a> for some of our classes, which is a system used at Harvard and other places.</p>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>Exercises are a huge part of our courses. We think that they serve two purposes: they consolidate what you just learnt in lecture, and when asked at later times, jog your brain into remembering what you learned a little while back. We hope youâ€™ll enjoy them.</p>
<p>You will be asked to solve exercises every 2-3 lecture segments. Its more important you participate than get them right, your grade on them is weighted towards participation rather than correctness. Without participation, <a href="/ml2-c1/slack.html">conversation</a>, <a href="/ml2-c1/discourse.html">discussion</a>, there is no learning.</p>
<p>From time to time, weâ€™ll create ad-hoc tests as well, without grading, so that you can self-check your learning progress.</p>
