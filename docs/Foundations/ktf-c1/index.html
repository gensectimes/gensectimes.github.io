<blockquote>
<p><em>Statistics. Math. Computer Science. Physics. Long ago, the four disciplines lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Computer Science attacked. Only a master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed it most, it was not invented. A few years ago the world discovered the new master, a scientist called data scientist,a master of all four elements</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Welcome to the <strong>First Edition</strong> of AI1. The objective of this module is to provide fundamental understandings of machine learning models and get you working with the basic concepts of ML and AI.</p>
<p>You will start with the regression models (KNN, Linear, Multi, Poly) and then move on to classification models (kNN, Logistic).</p>
<p>Finally, the course will provide a basic understanding of modern neural networks. Along the way, you will operationalize the key concepts of machine learning: picking the right complexity, preventing overfitting, regularization, and model evaluation.</p>
<p>At the end of this module, you will be able to run basic machine learning models, and tell how well they are performing.</p>
<p>This page introduces you to the team, the basic instructions, the schedule and various elements of our class.</p>

<h2 id="the-coursework">The Coursework</h2>
<p>We have very carefully designed the coursework to give you, the student, a wholesome learning experience.</p>
<p>Each week shall include:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 Sessions</li>
<li>2 Labs</li>
<li>Office hours</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="session---what-to-expect">Session - What to expect</h3>
<p><img src="https://github.com/hargun3045/blog-dump/blob/master/pavlos-website/lecture.png?raw=true" /></p>
<p>A session will have the following pedagogy layout which will be repeated four times:</p>
<ul>
<li>Approx. 15 minutes of live online instruction followed by approx 15 minutes of Q/A + Quiz + Exercises.</li>
<li>Sessions will help students develop the intuition for the core concepts, provide the necessary mathematical background, and provide guidance on technical details.</li>
<li>Sessions will be accompanied by relevant examples to clarify key concepts and techniques.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="lecture.PNG" /></p>
<h3 id="lab---what-to-expect">Lab - What to expect</h3>
<p><img src="https://github.com/hargun3045/blog-dump/blob/master/pavlos-website/lab.png?raw=true" /></p>
<p>A lab is a TA driven one hour session that is divided into 3 major parts. - Each lab begins by revisiting the Quizzes and Exercises done in the previous lecture session. - After discussing exercises, we will have a semi-formal Q/A session. All doubts pertaining, but not limited, to the previous session, and homeworks are welcome.</p>
<ul>
<li>The last part of the labs deals predominantly with the upcoming homeworks. It is directed towards giving a brief overview of the homework problem. We will discuss some code to help you get started.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="parting-note">Parting note</h2>
<p>As you will learn in this course, data science is not just about writing efficient algorithms.</p>
<p>It requires proficiency in critical thinking, ideation &amp; presentation, along with strong foundations in statistics, computer science &amp; mathematics.</p>
<p>Keeping that in mind, you are adviced to give your full active attention to every session, homework &amp; exercise.</p>
<p>We wish you best of luck for your data science journey.</p>
