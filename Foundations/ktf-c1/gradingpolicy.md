## Module Structure


- Lectures with Labs interwoven in
- Almost every lecture has an accompanying Jupyter notebook (maybe more than one!). In some lectures we will work through the notebook. In other ones we wont: you are expected to read and work through the notebook after the lecture. In fact, it is not a bad idea to do this anyways: you will recall more.
- Every lecture has exercises after some sections. You are expected to do these exercises in class. You are not expected to get them right: it is more important for us (and you) that you participate. This participation **counts** towards your grade. You will always be able to go back to these exercises.
- Homework: There will be a homework every week with a maximum of 2 questions. This homework should not take more than 7-8 hours.
- Participation is key and carries points

## Grading, Collaboration, and Citation

Everything will be graded holistically beyond mechanical correctness and focusing on the overall quality of the work.

The grades for different parts of the module are as follows:

- Quiz's: 15 (5 points for correctness and 10 points for participation)
- Homework (3 of them): 45
- Project: 30
- Other Participation: 10 . This includes participation in class, and most importantly participation on the discussion forums.

On a five point scale, roughly:

- A = Excellent
- A- = Quite Good
- B+ = Fair
- B = Did not work hard/Did not understand

In addition to the scores the Teaching Fellows will give detailed written feedback at the end of the module.

### Collaboration Policy

“You can talk to anyone and collaborate with up-to two additional people on any homework"

What does this mean, exactly?


- You can work together  in groups of minimum 1 person and 3 people.
- However, each student must submit their own homework. Thus if you worked with 2 other students, all 3 of you would submit identical copies of the homework. On these copies, you MUST mention, at the top of the homework (or homework README file if it is a github repository submission), all the students who did the homework together (in this case, 3 names.)
- While you are working on the homework, you can talk to anyone (even outside your group).
- Attribution is key!! Anything that you “borrow” from someone/someplace else please make sure to attribute!!!

### Quoting Sources

You must acknowledge any source code that was not written by you by mentioning the original author(s) directly in your source code (comment or header). You can also acknowledge sources in a README.txt file if you used whole classes or libraries. Do not remove any original copyright notices and headers. 

You are encouraged to use libraries, unless explicitly stated otherwise! You may use examples you find on the web as a starting point, provided their licenses allow you to re-use it. You must quote the source using  proper citations (author, title, URL) both in the source code and in any publicly visible material. 

### Deadlines and Late Days

Homework must be turned in on time. You can have upto 2 late days across the module, with no more than 1 late day on any homework. No late days on the final project.

Exceptions: None. No exceptions, except for illness, with a doctor's certificate.

### Regrading Policy

If you think we were too harsh, please ask for a regrade *within a day* of getting your grade.




## Additional Information

**Credits**

Some of the material in this (or any) module is based on other classes, other nice examples. We also draw on materials and examples found online and try our best to give credit by linking to the original source. Sometimes we mess up. Please contact us if you find materials where the credit is missing.


**Code**

We expect you to write readable, well commented python code. You should strive for doing things the right way and think about aspects such as reusability, error handling, etc. We also expect you to reasonably document your code.
