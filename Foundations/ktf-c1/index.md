## Artificial Intelligence - C001 ðŸ¤–

>*Statistics, Math, Computer Science. Physics.Long ago, the four disciplines lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Computer Science attacked. Only data science, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed it most, it was not invented. A few years ago the world  discovered the new master, a data scientist called  Pavlos, whose mission was to train the next generation in the mystic arts of Data Science*

Welcome to the **First Edition** AI-C001.

This page introduces you to your team, the basic instructions and the schedule of the various elements of our class.


We assume you have a [Univ.AI](https://courses.univ.ai) account, created when you signed up at [courses.univ.ai](https://courses.univ.ai). If not, email [programs@univ.ai](mailto:programs@univ.ai).



### Education software we use

- Our lectures and labs are carried out via [Zoom](zoom.md) (install instructions).
- Quizzes & exercises will be conducted on the digital learning platform [Ed](https://edstem.org/).
- Ocassionally, we may conduct in-class contests on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Please register on kaggle and familarize yourself with it, if you haven't already done so.

Scientific Director of the Institute for
Applied Computational Science (IACS).<br>Teaches CS109a, CS109b and the
Capstone course for the Data Science
masters program. <br>He is a leader in
astrostatistics and he is excited about
the new telescopes coming online in
the next few years. He loves cooking
and eating.

### The Class

- Lectures with Labs interwoven in, supported by your professor and TAs.
- Every lecture has exercises after some sections. You are expected to do these exercises in class. You are not expected to get them right: it is more important for us (and you) that you participate. This participation **counts** towards your grade. You will always be able to go back to these exercises.
- Homework: There will be a homework every week with a maximum of 2 questions. This homework should not take more than 7-8 hours.
- Participation is key and carries points
- Additional office hours are scheduled as well to help you with additional questions.
Your TAs and professors will be there to help with the material, homework, and any other questions you might have.


Our module policies around collaboration and grading are listed [here](policy.md). Our expectations of you are also laid out in that document.

### Course Pre-Requisites 

Your are expected to have a working knowledge of python, along with these three libraries:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

All exercises in this course will be done in [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)

> Note: No prior knowledge of machine learning libraries is necessary for this module


Before you begin the course, we have prepared for you a simple exercise to ensure your proficieny of the above libraries. 

This will help you assess your preparedness for the course, and will also help you familiarize yourself with the platform.

### Parting note

As you will learn in this course, data science is not just about writing efficient algorithms.

It requires proficiency in critical thinking, ideation & presentation, along with strong foundations in statistics, computer science & mathematics.

Keeping that in mind, you are adviced to give your full active attention to every session, homework & exercise.

We wish you best of luck for your data science journey.
