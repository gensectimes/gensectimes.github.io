<h2 id="ai-3--language-models">AI-3 : Language Models</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Sunny day Sweepin’ the clouds away, On my way to where the air is sweet, Can you tell me how to get, How to get to Sesame Street?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Welcome to the <strong>First Edition</strong> of AI3. 
The objective of this module is to provide fundamental understandings of the latest language models built using deep learning architectures.</p>

<p>You will start with the traditional language models, learn about word embeddings, attention and then move on to transformer models.</p>

<p>At the end of this module, 
you will be able to build efficient language models, and tell how well they are performing.</p>

<p>This page introduces you to the team, the basic instructions, the schedule and various elements of our class.</p>

<h2 id="the-coursework">The Coursework</h2>

<p>We have very carefully designed the coursework to give you, the student, a wholesome learning experience.</p>

<p>Each week shall include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2 Sessions</li>
  <li>2 Labs</li>
  <li>Office hours</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="session---what-to-expect">Session - What to expect</h3>

<p><img src="index.assets/session.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Before the session begins, students are expected to complete a pre-class reading assignment and and attempt a quiz based on the same.</p>

<p>A session will have the following pedagogy layout which will be repeated three times:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Approx. 15 minutes of live online instruction followed by approx 15 minutes of Q/A + Quiz + Exercises.</li>
  <li>Sessions will help students develop the intuition for the core concepts, 
 provide the necessary mathematical background, and provide guidance on technical details.</li>
  <li>Sessions will be accompanied by relevant examples to clarify key concepts and techniques.</li>
</ul>

<p>After the session, students are expected to complete a short post-class quiz based on the principal concepts covered in class.</p>

<h3 id="lab---what-to-expect">Lab - What to expect</h3>

<p><img src="https://github.com/hargun3045/blog-dump/blob/master/pavlos-website/varlab.png?raw=true" alt="" /></p>

<p>A lab is a TA driven one hour session that is divided into 3 major parts.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each lab begins by revisiting the 
Quizzes and Exercises done in the previous lecture session.</li>
  <li>
    <p>After discussing exercises,
we will have a semi-formal Q/A session. All doubts pertaining, but not limited, to the previous session, 
and homeworks are welcome.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The last part of the labs deals predominantly with the upcoming homeworks. It is 
directed towards giving a brief overview of the homework problem. We will discuss some code to help you get started.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="diversity--inclusion">Diversity &amp; Inclusion</h2>

<p>We actively seek and welcome people of diverse identities, from across the spectrum of disciplines and methods since Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly mediates our social, cultural, economic, and political interactions [1].</p>

<p>We believe in creating and maintaining an inclusive learning environment where all members feel safe, respected, and capable of producing their best work.</p>

<p>We commit to an experience for all participants that is free from – Harassment, bullying, and discrimination which includes but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Offensive comments related to age, race, religion, creed, color, gender (including transgender/gender identity/gender expression), sexual orientation, medical condition, physical or intellectual disability, pregnancy, or medical conditions, national origin or ancestry.</li>
  <li>Intimidation, personal attacks, harassment, unnecessary disruption of talks during any of the learning activities.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="parting-note">Parting note</h2>

<p>As you will learn in this course, language models are not just about writing efficient algorithms.</p>

<p>It requires proficiency in critical thinking, ideation &amp; presentation, along with strong foundations in statistics, computer science &amp; mathematics.</p>

<p>Keeping that in mind, you are adviced to give your full active attention to every session, homework &amp; exercise.</p>

<p>We wish you best of luck for your AI journey.</p>
