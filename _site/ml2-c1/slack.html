<ul>

  <li>just get to know everyone</li>
  <li>do a quick video chat with another person or with members of your group (<code class="highlighter-rouge">/jitsi</code> on any channel is the ticket)</li>
  <li>collect questions while lecture is on to ask the professor</li>
  <li>do polls<img src="slack.assets/Screenshot 2020-07-01 02.39.34.png" alt="" /></li>
  <li>point people to questions answered or discussions had on discourse. Type <code class="highlighter-rouge">/discourse help</code> for details. You can even archive some parts of conversations to discourse.</li>
</ul>
